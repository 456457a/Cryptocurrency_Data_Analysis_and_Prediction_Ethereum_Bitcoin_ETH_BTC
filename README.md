# Cryptocurrency_Data_Analysis_and_Prediction_Ethereum_Bitcoin_ETH_BTC
In these Python and R scripts, markdown and notebooks, I provide a basis for understanding how the cryptocurrencies market works, as well as how we can divide it into categories, supported by a hierarchical clustering. Other contributions regard the accurate prediction of Bitcoin and Ether Prices one day ahead and nice data bases with which to play around and test my results, if wanted. 
This repository contains part of the code used for the development of my TFG (Graduate thesis). It consists on developing a trading strategy for cryptocurrencies, by using different ML and AI methods. Although more research needs to be carried out, the algorithms provided here were proved to be able to beat the market, selecting the correct trading strategy based on them. 
If anyone finds this repository of help, you can always donate to the following wallets :) I will appreciate it very much.
